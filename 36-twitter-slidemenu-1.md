# Replicating Twitter Slide Menu - Part 1



In this post, we will breakdown, analyze the Slide Menu mechanism of Twitter app, and try to replicate it using Auto Layout and Container View. This post assume you have some experience working with [Auto Layout](https://fluffy.es/making-sense-of-auto-layout/).



Main screen of Twitter app consist of a tab view controller. If you swipe right, a side menu will appear.

When the side menu is open, both side menu view and tab bar view appear in the same screen. The screen (which is a view controller) contain both of the side menu view controller and tab bar view controller :

We can achieve this using two container view in the Main View Controller.

If you are planning to start the project from scratch, the steps below assume you already have tab bar controller and a view controller for side menu prepared.



## Setup Container View for Tab bar controller

To accomodate the side menu and tab bar controllers, we will create a new view controller named **MainViewController** , and drag a container view to it.



![Drag container view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/dragContainerView.png)



After dragging, you will see that Xcode auto link a new view controller to the Container view. We don't need this new controller, select the link (segue) and press delete to remove the link, then delete the attached view controller.

![selectSegue](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/selectSegue.png)



Then we will link the container view to the tab bar view controller. Select the Container view, then hold control and drag it to the tab bar controller. Select "**Embed**".

![select embed](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/selectEmbed.png)



You might see the tab bar controller shrinked to match the container view size ðŸ˜±, no worries, we will add some constraint to the container view so that it will match the screen size.



// change to top 0, leading 0 ,equal width, equal height

Let's create a top 0, leading 0, trailing 0 and bottom 0 constraints for the container view like this : 

![container view constraints](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/containerViewConstraint.png)





As by default Xcode align the top / bottom constraint to Safe Area, the container view will have some margin on top/ bottom when viewed in iPhone X / XR / XS : 



![safe area](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/safeArea.png)



We want the container view to align to the screen top and bottom, not safe area, hence we will need to edit the constraint.


Select the container view and double click its Align Top constraint : 

![doubleClick](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/doubleClickTopConstraint.png)



Change the "**Safe Area**" in First/Second Item to "**Superview**", and then set the constant to **0** .

![safe area to superview](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/safeAreaToSuperview.png)



Remember to set the constant to zero as Xcode will auto change the value when you change Safe Area to Superview.

![superview zero](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/superviewConstantZero.png)



Repeat this step for the bottom constraint.



After adjusting the top/bottom constraint, set the MainViewController as the initial view controller.

![initial view controller](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/initialViewController.png)



Build and run the app, you now should have a container view containing the tab bar controller ðŸ™Œ. 



![super view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/superviewArea.png)



As we will add another container view for side menu later on, we should give a label to the tab bar container view so we can identify it later. Let's label it as **ContentView**.

![label content view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section1/contentViewLabel.png)



## Setup Container View for Side Menu View Controller

Similar to previous section, drag another container view to MainViewController, link it to the side menu view controller, setup constraints (top 0, leading 0, trailing 0, bottom 0) and change the safe area to superview.



![container view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/36-twitter-slidemenu-1/section2/controlDrag2.png)



Add a label to this container view, we will label it as **SideMenuView**
