# Using launch arguments / environment variables to simulate in-app purchase purchased and etc



If you have experience programming in other language like Ruby , Python, Java etc, you might have used environment variable to store secrets. There's environment variable in iOS as well, these are injected to your app in runtime.



Here's how I learned to use launch argument / environment variable the hard way :



In my app [Komuter](https://komuter.app), users will need to purchase in-app purchase to view upcoming trains arrival time.

![purchase](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/purchase.png)



In this screen, I call a function `hasPurchasedPro()` to check if the user has purchased in-app purchase. If the user has bought in-app purchase, the buy button and blurred text will be hidden, and the actual upcoming train time will be shown.



```swift
func hasPurchasedPro(){
  // check Keychain to see if the purchase data exist or not
  // return true if it exist, else false
}
```

<br>

(You can read more on [how to check if user has bought in-app purchase using Keychain here](https://fluffy.es/check-purchased-iap-using-keychain/))



During development / testing, I used the simulator a lot and as simulator can't perform in-app purchase, I modified the code slightly like this so the screen will always show the full train time (easier for me to check)  :

```swift
func hasPurchasedPro(){
  
  return true
  
  // check Keychain to see if the purchase data exist or not
  // return true if it exist, else false
}
```

<br>



I would often comment and uncomment the line `return true` between development and production (submitting to App Store). And yes you have guessed correctly, one time I forgot to remove the `return true` statement and submitted the App to App Store ðŸ˜…. The app got approved and my app has zero revenue for a week before I realized what I have done, giving away the full version of the app for users for free during that week ðŸ˜‚ðŸ’¸. 



"There must be a better way to do this!", I thought, then I stumbled across **Launch arguments** / **Environment Variables** , which you can set certain variables which will only be injected during debug run (it has no effect when you archive the app and submit to App Store).



## How to set launch arguments / environment variables

To set launch arguments / environment variables, go to **Product** > **Scheme** > **Manage Schemes** .



![Manage scheme](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/manageScheme.png)



Then double click the scheme with your app name : 

![double click](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/doubleClick.png)



In the scheme window, select **Run (Debug)**  on the left side bar, and then select the **Arguments** tab on the right column. You will see two row **Arguments Passed On Launch** and **Environment Variables**. For the in-app purchase, we will set a launch argument by clicking the **+** button.

![arguments](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/arguments.png)



Then we type in `BOUGHT` (can be any string you like) as one of the arguments.


Then in the **hasPurchasedPro** function, we can modify it to check for launch argument like this :

```swift
func hasPurchasedPro(){
  // if there is a 'BOUGHT' launch argument, simulate bought in-app purchase
  if ProcessInfo.processInfo.arguments.contains("BOUGHT") {
    return true
  }
  
  // check Keychain to see if the purchase data exist or not
  // return true if it exist, else false
  // ...
}
```

<br>



Build and run the app, we then see the app showing the unlocked screen ðŸ™Œ : 

![bought](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/bought.png)



To revert back to the unpurchased state, simply uncheck the launch argument and build and run the app again : 

![uncheck](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/uncheck.png)



Then we will see the screen with buy button and blurred text : 

![havent buy](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/haventBuy.png)



With launch arguments, we can toggle different state easily, and no need to worry if we have accidentally shipped the full version of the app to the App Store ðŸ˜…, as launch arguments / environment variables will not be included in Archive / Production version of the app.



The process is similar for environment variables, open the scheme window, and click the **+** button under **Environment Variables**. The difference is that you can set a key value pair for environment variable, whereas you can only set a string for launch argument.



![environment variable](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2018/42-environment-variables/envvar.png)



Then in your code, you can check for the value of environment variables like this : 

```swift

```
