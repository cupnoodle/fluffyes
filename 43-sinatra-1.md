Ever wondered how a REST API that returns JSON is being created? You asked around and many suggestion came up: Python Flask Django Ruby Rails Sinatra Node js express Swift Kitura etc, which should you choose? ðŸ˜± 



In this post, we will be using Ruby (the language) and Sinatra (the framework/library to build a web server easily). Ruby syntax is similar to Swift, this post won't cover the whole Ruby syntax but will explain what does each line of ruby code do.



This post will cover :

1. Installing Ruby and Sinatra
2. Writing your first REST API
3. Return JSON for API
4. Deploy your REST API online to Heroku
5. Connect your REST API in iOS app using URLSession
