# Is it worth making an app where similar apps already exist in the App Store?



You thought of a great idea, got excited, open up Xcode and proceed to code it. And after a while...  "Wait... what if someone already did this?" , you then did a quick search and bam, there's already dozens of similar apps. "Ah snap, well my idea isn't that original, someone surely could've thought of it earlier than me, right? ðŸ˜¢"




If the scenario above sounds like you, no worries! I have been there before (multiple times) and I understand it can feel devastating ðŸ˜….



The short answer for "Is it worth making an app where similar apps already exist in the App Store?" is **Yes, you should make it anyway**.



This post will explain why it is worth it to do it.



## If this is your first app, just do it!

If this is your very first app, just do it. Having an app in the App Store demonstrate that you are able to start an app from scratch, develop its feature and design (stock UI from Xcode drag and drop is fine), and most importantly, **ship it to the App Store**. Being able to [ship is an important skill](https://stackingthebricks.com/podcast/ep4-shipping-is-a-skill/), this shows a lot of self-motivation / passion (Having an app in App Store says a lot more than just putting "passionate about coding" in Resume when applying for jobs) and also demonstrate coding ability to your employers. If you are a hiring manager, would you hire a self-proclaimed iOS developer without an app in the App Store? 



I shipped two apps ([Foxkana](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/foxkana/id1003068444?mt=8) and [uPush, now defunct](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/upush/id981950322)) to the App Store before graduating University. These two apps are not unique and there are already dozens of similar apps in the App Store, I gained some iOS development experience (learned Objective-C, Delegate, calling API andparsing JSON etc) while developing those apps, stuffed these into my resume, and managed to get a decent iOS developer job right after graduating. During the interview, I showed my app source code to the interviewer and explained how I did those features, she got impressed and hired me without asking much technical questions. 



Having an App in App Store (and also the source code to back it up that it's done by you) shows proof to employer that you actually know what you are doing.



## Would you learn something new from making this app?

Ignoring existing competition in the App Store, would you learn something new from making this app? Say  you don't have prior experience on calling HTTP REST API and parsing JSON and you want to make a weather app (there's hundred of these in App Store already), should you give up on making this app because of the competition? Of course not! By making this app, you might learn how to use [URLSession](https://fluffy.es/nsurlsession-urlsession-tutorial/) to call API, parse JSON using [Codable](https://fluffy.es/parse-json-using-decodable-protocol/) , [how to get value out of closure](https://fluffy.es/return-value-from-a-closure/) etc, these are valuable skills as an iOS developer as majority of iOS job requirement requires this. Same goes to if you want to make a game using Spritekit, photo editing app using Core Graphics etc. If you can learn new library / framework / design pattern by making this app, you could increase your technical competency and perhaps check off more requirement boxes when you apply for your next job.



When I was developing [Komuter](https://Komuter.app), I wanted to learn how to implement In-app purchase. There are already two competitors doing the same app, and their apps are free (supported with advertisement). I worried a lot on "Will people use my app if my competitors are giving their app away for free?" during the development, and still proceed to finish it and submit to the App Store anyway because my aim was to **learn** how to implement In-app purchase that time, I didn't expect to earn any profit from the app. This experience helped me to get my second iOS dev job, which required experience in handling in-app purchase and validation check since the company's app is dealing with in-app subscription.



If you can learn something new from making this app, be it technical skill or complementary skill (eg: design, copywriting, marketing etc), why not?



## But what if I want to earn money from it? Do I stand a chance?

Now we're talkin'. Making money on App Store is an entire field of study of its own, there's business model (paid app, in-app purchase, subscription, ads), pricing, marketing, App Store search result optimization etc.

Before worrying on marketing, ask yourself that **does your app solves a genuine problem**? What is the app's target audience ('everyone' is too general), would using your app make their day better? Would you use your own app one month from now?
