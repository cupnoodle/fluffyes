# Get current location using Core Location (Tutorial)



Last month, I added a show nearby train station feature to my app [Rapidly](https://rapidkl.app) .  // need to refer multiple tutorials for this, hence I decided to make a quick guide on this.




// Remember asynchronous, it takes quite some time for the phone to retrieve the location data, hence it will continue executing code below first



// requestLocationDataOnce takes more time than the start / stop requesting location data delegate



// higher accuracy location data requires longer time to retrieve, use the least accuracy you need to save time
