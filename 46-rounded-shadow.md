# Implementing rounded corner image view with shadow

Since iOS 11, the App Store app has adopted card UI like this :

![Card UI](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/AppStoreCard.png)



The card-like UI has rounded corner and a light drop shadow beneath it, how can we achieve it?



Say we have a image view like this : 

![imageView](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/imageView.png)



## Implementing shadow

To add a drop shadow, we can modify the shadowColor, shadowOffset, shadowRadius and shadowOpacity properties of the image view's layer :

```swift
// inside viewDidLoad

// the color of the shadow
imageView.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.darkGray.cgColor

// the shadow will be 5pt right and 5pt below the image view 
// negative value will place it on left / above of the image view
imageView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 5.0, height: 5.0)

// how long the shadow will be. The longer the shadow, the more blurred it will be
imageView.layer.shadowRadius = 25.0

// opacity of the shadow
imageView.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.9
```

<br>



After implementing the code above, here's how the image view looks like :

Looking good! In the next section, we will look into how to implement corner radius separately.



## Implementing rounded corner

To implement rounded corner, we can change the cornerRadius property of the image view layer like this : 

```swift
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 25.0
```

<br>

Build and run the app, then we will get this output : 

![image view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/imageView.png)



Wait, why the image view doesn't get rounded? ðŸ¤”

When we set the layer.cornerRadius to 25.0 pt, we are actually setting the bounds of the image view like this : 

![imageView bounds](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/bounds.png)

The bounds are rounded, but the image is not following the boundary (bounds) and extended outside the boundary.



To solve this, we can set the **clipsToBounds** property to true so that the image will be confined inside the boundary.

```swift
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 25.0
imageView.clipsToBounds = true
```

<br>



Now the image view is rounded, ðŸ™Œ!

 In the next section, we will look into how to implement both corner radius and shadow together.



## Issue with implementing rounded corner with shadow

Since we now know how to implement rounded corner and shadow, let's combine them and we shall get the App Store card-like UI .



```swift
imageView.layer.cornerRadius = 25.0
imageView.clipsToBounds = true

imageView.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.darkGray.cgColor
imageView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 5.0, height: 5.0)
imageView.layer.shadowRadius = 25.0
imageView.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.9
```

<br>

Build and run the app and we will get an output like this : 

![rounded corner only](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/rounded.png)



Wait... where did the shadow go? Why combining rounded corner and shadow makes the shadow go away?! 



Remember the **bounds** and **clipsToBounds = true** we mentioned earlier? When we set clipsToBounds = true, the content (image) will be confined inside the rounded bounds. As the shadow is outside the bounds, it got clipped out :



![clipsToBounds](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/clipsToBounds.png)

Notice the shadow got clipped after setting clipsToBounds = true.



As we need clipsToBounds = true to make the image become rounded, how can we achieve both rounded corner and shadow effect for the image? ðŸ¤”



There's many solutions (some require drawing custom layer ) to this, one of the straightforward solution would be using multiple views (1 view for shadow, 1 view for rounded corner) to achieve the same effect. We will look into this method in the next section.



## Implementing rounded corner with shadow 

Here's an overview on using two views to achieve rounded corner with shadow effect : 

![two views](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/twoViews.png)



We will create a container view (the top white view with shadow) and put the clipped rounded corner image view inside the container view.



First, drag a view into the storyboard and create an outlet for it (container view) :

![container view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/containerView.png)



```swift
// container view and image view have the same corner radius
let cornerRadius : CGFloat = 25.0

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    containerView.layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius
    containerView.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.darkGray.cgColor
    containerView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 5.0, height: 5.0)
    containerView.layer.shadowRadius = 25.0
    containerView.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.9
}
```

<br>



We will get the shadow effect on the container view like this :

![shadow effect](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/shadowView.png)


Next, we will place the image view inside the container view, and add cornerRadius and clipsToBounds = true to it.



![image view inside container view](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/imageViewInside.png)



```swift
// container view and image view have the same corner radius
let cornerRadius : CGFloat = 25.0

override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()

    // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

    containerView.layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius
    containerView.layer.shadowColor = UIColor.darkGray.cgColor
    containerView.layer.shadowOffset = CGSize(width: 5.0, height: 5.0)
    containerView.layer.shadowRadius = 25.0
    containerView.layer.shadowOpacity = 0.9
  
    imageView.layer.cornerRadius = cornerRadius
    imageView.clipsToBounds = true
}
```

<br>



Build and run the app, now we get a rounded corner + shadow card UI ! ðŸŽ‰

## Performance impact and remedies

Using cornerRadius and shadow on a view can have a hit on performance especially when the view is inside a tableview cell which its position changes often (due to scrolling).



There is a [shadowPath](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore/calayer/1410771-shadowpath) property for a view's layer,  which by default is set to nil. When this property is nil, the system will look at the contents / bounds of the view and try to create a shadow that matches the shape of view. To reduce the system burden, we can set the shadowPath property so the system won't need to infer the view to calculate how to draw the shadow.



We can set the shadow path to follow the path of the rounded container view :

```swift
// create a path following the rounded corner image
containerView.layer.shadowPath = UIBezierPath(roundedRect: imageView.bounds, cornerRadius: cornerRadius).cgPath
```

<br>



The **UIBezierPath(roundedRect: imageView.bounds, cornerRadius: cornerRadius).cgPath** will create a path like this : 

![shadow path](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/46-rounded-shadow/shadowPath2.png)





As for cornerRadius, there's many article on the internet saying you should avoid it as much as possible. Personally I haven't experienced a dealbreaker performance issue using cornerRadius on a recent device (iPhone 6 and newer), one remedy for reducing the performance impact on using cornerRadius would be to [mask the image into a rounded image using CoreGraphics](https://rbnsn.me/improving-scrolling-performance-of-circles-on-ios) first and thus achieving rounded corner image without needing to use cornerRadius.
