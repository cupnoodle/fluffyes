# Download files sequentially using URLSession inside OperationQueue

There might be scenario where your app have to download external resource files from the internet, as URLSession is asynchronous, if we call multiple dataTask or downloadTask in the code, they might all run together and make multiple requests to the server at the same time. 



```swift
// yes I know using force unwrap is bad
// urls are ordered in alphabetical order
let urls = [
    URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/AppStoreCard/archive/master.zip")!,
    URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/currentLocation/archive/master.zip")!,
    URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/DispatchQueue/archive/master.zip")!,
    URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/dynamicFont/archive/master.zip")!,
    URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/telegrammy/archive/master.zip")!
]

// call multiple urlsession downloadtask, these will all run at the same time!
for url in urls {
    print("start fetching \(url.absoluteString)")
    URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url, completionHandler: { (tempURL, response, error) in
        print("finished fetching \(url.absoluteString)")
    }).resume()
}
```

<br>



Some external API might have restriction that only 1 request can be made at the same time from the same IP address, performing multiple requests at the same time might result in HTTP status 403 Forbidden ! Or worse, all the heavy downloadTasks run concurrently and your app gets overloaded and crash!



You might have heard of **OperationQueue** and tried to download files sequentially using operation queue like this :



```swift
let queue = OperationQueue()
// set maxConcurrentOperationCount to 1 so that only one operation can be run at one time
queue.maxConcurrentOperationCount = 1

// yes I know using force unwrap is bad
// urls are ordered in alphabetical order
let urls = [
  URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/AppStoreCard/archive/master.zip")!,
  URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/currentLocation/archive/master.zip")!,
  URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/DispatchQueue/archive/master.zip")!,
  URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/dynamicFont/archive/master.zip")!,
  URL(string: "https://github.com/fluffyes/telegrammy/archive/master.zip")!
]

for url in urls {
    
  let operation = BlockOperation(block: {
    print("start fetching \(url.absoluteString)")
    URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url, completionHandler: { (tempURL, response, error) in
      print("finished fetching \(url.absoluteString)")
    }).resume()
  })

  queue.addOperation(operation)
}
```

<br>

 

But when you run it, all the download tasks are being executed at the same time even though **maxConcurrentOperationCount** is set to 1 ! ðŸ˜±

Why did this happen? 



This is because of URLSession dataTask / downloadTask  **.resume()** method is asynchronous, meaning it will return / complete immediately and move to the next line before the response is retrieved.



Say we have the following code : 

```swift
print("before URLSession downloadTask")
URLSession.shared.downloadTask(with: url, completionHandler: { (tempURL, response, error) in
    print("finished downloadTask")
}).resume()
print("after URLSession downloadTask")
```

<br>



This will result on the following output : 

```
before URLSession downloadTask
after URLSession downloadTask
finished downloadTask
```

<br>



Your program will continue to execute the line **print("after URLSession downloadTask")** right after calling **.resume()** without waiting for the response to be retrieved.



Operation has 3 states (ready, executing, finish), the way block operation works is that right before the code inside the block is executed, it is in **ready** state, when the code inside the block is being executed, it is in **executed** state, and when the last line of the code inside the block has finished executing, its state become **finished** , and the operation queue will move on to another operation.



![Ready executing finish](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/53-download-files-sequentially/readyFinishedLine.png)



As you have guessed, the operation state will become finished right after it execute the **print("after URLSession downloadTask")** line, even before the downloadTask has completed, and then the operation queue will move on to another block operation and repeat the same thing. Before the first downloadTask is completed, all other downloadTasks has been started (resumed) !



This is why all the download tasks are being executed at (almost) the same time even though **maxConcurrentOperationCount** is set to 1.



As BlockOperation will execute code from top to bottom and set the state to finish when the last line has been executed, we can't use BlockOperation to make sequential URLSession calls, we will need to create our own subclass of **Operation**. In this custom subclass, we will define when the operation is finished, which is **when the downloadTask has been completed**, instead of when it reach the last line of code.
