It can be really frustrating when you are following an online tutorial on how to implement in-app purchase, but there's no product returned from the SKProductsRequest ! ðŸ˜±



![zero product count](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/zerocount.png)





I have seen this question appears a lot of time in discussion forums, comment section of the in-app purchase tutorial or youtube video. Usually the culprit of this issue is related to banking information or you didn't agree to the contract, Apple might not process your in-app purchase products if you didn't complete banking / tax / agreements information, or if you didn't input your in-app purchase correctly.



Here's a checklist (in order from top to bottom) you can check if there is no SKProduct returned from request.



## 1. You must have a paid Apple developer account

Yes, in order to test or implement in-app purchase, you must have a paid Apple developer account. There's no way around it, you can enroll it here if you haven't : https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/



## 2. Your free and paid apps agreements status are active

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Agreements**' tab above.



![app store](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/appStoreconnect.png)



Make sure both of the '**Paid Apps**' and '**Free Apps**' agreement are in '**Active**' state with green dot.

![agreements](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/Agreements.png)



Occasionally Apple might update the agreement terms, which you need to click '**request agreement**' link in this page, and click 'Agree' on it to make the status become 'Active'.





## 3. You have added the necessary Tax information

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Tax**' tab above.



![app store](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/appStoreconnect.png)



At the bare minimum, you must add the tax information for United States as Apple is a company located in United States. If you live in a country where digital products are taxed, you might need to add the tax information of your country too.

## 4. You have added Banking information

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Banking**' tab above.



![app store](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/appStoreconnect.png)

You must add at least one banking account, which Apple can transfer your apps earning to you.

## 5. You have created an explicit App ID for your app

To use in-app purchase capability, you would need a specific bundle ID for your app (can't use the wildcard bundle ID which is auto-generated by Xcode).


If you haven't created an App ID for your app yet, head over to [Certificates, Identifier & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) in developer center, select '**Identifiers**' on the left tab, then click the "+" button to add a new identifier.



![ios image](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/Identifiers.png)





Select '**App ID**' , then click '**Next**'.

![new app id](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/newAppID.png)



Ensure the **Bundle ID** of the App ID is **the same as** the bundle ID of your app's **Xcode project** bundle ID, and make sure the bundle ID is **Explicit** : 

![bundle ID of app ID](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/bundleIDAppID.png)



![Xcode bundle ID](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/bundleIDXcode.png)



The "In app-purchase" capability in the App ID registration page should be checked by default, feel free to check any other capability you might need, then click 'Register' to register the app ID.



## 6. You have created an app in App Store Connect, with the correct App ID

To create in-app purchase for your app, you must create an app in [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/). If you haven't already , go to App Store Connect and select '**My Apps**'.

![my app](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/muhApp.png)



Then click the '**+**' sign at top left to create a new app.

![new app](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/newApp.png)



Fill in the details of your app. For the Bundle ID, select the bundle ID (of the app ID) you've created in previous step.

![new app bundle id](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/newAppBundleID.png)



Click 'Create', and you will see your app appear in App Store Connect.



## 7. You have created the in-app purchase item in App Store Connect

Assuming you have created your app in App Store Connect, the next step is the create the in-app purchase product for your app.



Select your app in App Store Connect -> My Apps, then click the '**Features**' tab on top.



![Features tab](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/appFeatureTab.png)





Select '**In-App Purchases**' on the left side bar, then click '+' to add a new in-app purchase product.

![app iap](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/appIAP.png)



Select the in-app purchase you want to create, then click '**Create**'. 

![iap type](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/iapType.png)



**Consumable** product example: Coins, user can buy coin and consume it in your app (to buy virtual item), **user can buy** the coin **multiple times**.



**Non-Consumable** product example: Remove Ads feature / Pro feature, **user can only buy the feature once**, and after purchasing it, the feature is there forever.



**Auto-Renewable Subscription** product example: Subscription like Netflix / Spotify, where users' card will be charged a fixed amount every week / month / year, until user cancel it. This type of in-app purchase is the hardest to pass App Store Review, and you must justify to Apple why your app is charging user monthly (eg: provide ongoing new content / has monthly server fees etc).



**Non-Renewing Subscription** product example : Shameless plug, I used non-renewing subscription for my app, [Komuter](https://apps.apple.com/my/app/komuter-ktmb-timetable/id1201793160), user pay upfront for a fixed duration (eg: 3 months), then the user can view the premium content for 3 months. After 3 months has finished, user has to purchase again (another 3 months) in your app. Your app has to handle the logic of checking if user subscription is still valid (instead of letting Apple to handle the subscription tracking as in Auto-renewable subscription). Non-renewing subscription is a lot easier to pass App Store Review, I strongly suggest using this instead of auto-renewing subscription if you don't have ongoing server fees.



Select the in-app purchase type you want, then click '**Create**'.



Next, fill in the necessary information for your in-app purchase : 

![IAP Info 1](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/iapInfo1.png)



Make sure you have checked "**Cleared for Sale**" checkbox in the Availability section, this checkbox ensure that your in-app purchase is visible to user.



Take note of the **Product ID**, as your app code need to include this product ID to get the **SKProduct** object.



![IAP Info 2](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/iapInfo2.png)

Fill in  '**Display Name**' and '**Description**' fields, user will see these text on the purchase dialog when they buy the in-app purchase inside your app.



Last but not least, include a screenshot of the view which contain the buy button.

![IAP info 3 screenshot](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/iapInfo3.png)

I suggest using iPhone 8 simulator to navigate to the purchase screen, then press <kbd>Command</kbd> + **S** to take a screenshot, then upload this screenshot (as App Store Connect has strict limit on what image dimensions are acceptable)



In the review notes, describe how the user can access the purchase screen (eg: they need to press "X" button beside advertisement to activate the purchase screen). The App Store Reviewer will use this information to trigger the purchase screen, if the reviewer can't figure out how to buy the in-app purchase in your app, they might reject your app submission. 



After filling all the details, click '**Save**' on the top right corner. You should see that your in-app purchase status is "**Ready to Submit**.

![ready to submit](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/iapReadyToSubmit.png)



## 8. Your in-app purchase product status is 'Ready to Submit'

Would like to emphasize this again as I saw many developers didn't complete the in-app purchase information when creating the in-app purchase, **especially the screenshot** in Review information section.



If you didn't include all the necessary information for your in-app purchase, you might get the status '**Metadata missing**', which might make your in-app purchase not appearing when making a SKProductsRequest call.



Make sure to fill up all the necessary information and include a screenshot for review, then click 'Save' to make your in-app purchase product to become '**Ready to Submit**.

## 9. Your app's bundle ID in Xcode is the same as App Store Connect
