It can be really frustrating when you are following an online tutorial on how to implement in-app purchase, but there's no product returned from the SKProductsRequest ! ðŸ˜±

I have seen this question appears a lot of time in discussion forums, comment section of the in-app purchase tutorial or youtube video. Usually the culprit of this issue is related to banking information or you didn't agree to the contract, Apple might not process your in-app purchase products if you didn't complete banking / tax / agreements information, or if you didn't input your in-app purchase correctly.



Here's a checklist (in order from top to bottom) you can check if there is no SKProduct returned from request.



## 1. You must have a paid Apple developer account

Yes, in order to test or implement in-app purchase, you must have a paid Apple developer account. There's no way around it, you can enroll it here if you haven't : https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/



## 2. Your free and paid apps agreements status are active

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Agreements**' tab above.

Make sure both of the '**Paid Apps**' and '**Free Apps**' agreement are in '**Active**' state with green dot.

Occasionally Apple might update the agreement terms, which you need to click '**request agreement**' link in this page, and click 'Agree' on it to make the status become 'Active'.





## 3. You have added the necessary Tax information

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Tax**' tab above.

At the bare minimum, you must add the tax information for United States as Apple is a company located in United States. If you live in a country where digital products are taxed, you might need to add the tax information of your country too.

## 4. You have added Banking information

In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/), click on 'Agreements, Tax and Banking' , then click on the '**Banking**' tab above.

You must add at least one banking account, which Apple can transfer your apps earning to you.

## 5. You have created an App ID for your app (that uses in-app purchase)

To use in-app purchase capability, you would need a specific bundle ID for your app (can't use the wildcard bundle ID which is auto-generated by Xcode).


If you haven't created an App ID for your app yet, head over to [Certificates, Identifier & Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) in developer center, select '**Identifiers**' on the left tab, then click the "+" button to add a new identifier.

Select '**App ID**' , then click '**Next**'.

Ensure the **Bundle ID** of the App ID is **the same as** the bundle ID of your app's **Xcode project** bundle ID, and make sure the bundle ID is **Explicit** :

![Xcode bundle ID](https://iosimage.s3.amazonaws.com/2019/66-zero-iap-checklist/bundleIDXcode.png)



The "In app-purchase" capability in the App ID registration page should be checked by default, feel free to check any other capability you might need, then click 'Register' to register the app ID.



## 6. You have created an app in App Store Connect, with the correct App ID
