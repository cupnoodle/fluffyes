# Move view when keyboard is shown



Most likely you have worked on an app with multiple textfields, and when the keyboard show up, there's a chance that your text field will get covered by the keyboard! One solution for this is to move the view up when a keyboard is presented.

Right before a keyboard is shown on the screen, iOS will send a notification named **UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification** to your current active UIResponder (can be your view or view controller). The notification contains information of the keyboard such as the size of they keyboard, which you can use to calculate how much distance should the view move upward.



We can get the frame of the keyboard by accessing the key **UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey** from the userInfo dictionary of the notification. I noticed some of the StackOverflow answers use the key *keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey* instead of keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey , which might produce incorrect output as keyboardFrameBeginUserInfoKey contains the frame info of the keyboard **before** the keyboard animation starts (animation of keyboard move up from bottom of the screen). 



[Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/TextAndWebiPhoneOS/KeyboardManagement/KeyboardManagement.html) recommends using keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey as this contain the frame of the keyboard **after** the animation has ended.



```swift
// the frame of the keyboard
let keyboardSize = (notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as? NSValue)?.cgRectValue
```

<br>



We can then use this keyboardSize's height to move the root view Y origin upward like this : 

```swift
// ViewController.swift

// in ViewDidLoad, observe the keyboardWillShow notification
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
  
    // call the 'keyboardWillShow' function when the view controller receive notification that keyboard is going to be shown
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(ViewController.keyboardWillShow), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification, object: nil)
}

@objc func keyboardWillShow(notification: NSNotification) {       
    guard let keyboardSize = (notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as? NSValue)?.cgRectValue else {
       // if keyboard size is not available for some reason, dont do anything
       return
    }
  
  // move the root view up by the distance of keyboard height
  self.view.frame.origin.y = 0 - keyboardSize.height
}
```

<br>



And when user dismiss the keyboard, another notification will be fired, **UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification**. We then observe for this notification and move back the root view frame origin to **0** (it's original origin is zero).



```swift
// ViewController.swift

// in ViewDidLoad, observe the keyboardWillShow notification
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
  
    // call the 'keyboardWillShow' function when the view controller receive the notification that a keyboard is going to be shown
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(ViewController.keyboardWillShow), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillShowNotification, object: nil)
  
      // call the 'keyboardWillHide' function when the view controlelr receive notification that keyboard is going to be hidden
    NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(self, selector: #selector(ViewController.keyboardWillHide), name: UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification, object: nil)
}

@objc func keyboardWillShow(notification: NSNotification) {
        
    guard let keyboardSize = (notification.userInfo?[UIResponder.keyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as? NSValue)?.cgRectValue else {
       // if keyboard size is not available for some reason, dont do anything
       return
    }
  
  // move the root view up by the distance of keyboard height
  self.view.frame.origin.y = 0 - keyboardSize.height
}

@objc func keyboardWillHide(notification: NSNotification) {
  // move back the root view origin to zero
  self.view.frame.origin.y = 0
}
```

This will produce the output like below :

If you just want to move up the view origin y when keyboard is shown, this should do the trick. However this simple approach might push some textfield too high of the screen :

In this scenario, the username field is too high far off the screen and user can't view what they are typing! ðŸ˜…



One of the solution for this scenario is to check if the text field will be covered by the keyboard when the keyboard appear, if it will be covered , then move the whole view up; if not, then just leave the view as it is and show the keyboard since the text field is still visible.

How can we check if a textfield will get covered by the keyboard? First we get the **bottomY value of the textfield** (the bottom edge of the textfield), and compare it to the **visible range** (the screen area that is still visible after keyboard is presented). If the bottomY value is larger than the visible range (ie. the bottomY value of textfield is larger than the bottomY value of visible range), then only we move the view up.
