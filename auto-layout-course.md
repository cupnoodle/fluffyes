# Making sense of Auto Layout Series



Throughout this series of articles, you'll learn the **fundamentals** of how Auto Layout works and you will be able to design UI, press the build and run button confidently knowing that the layout will work exactly as you want in the simulator.

Unlike other tutorials, we won't show you a complex layout and ask you to follow instructions step by step. We will instead explain how the fundamental works and let you connect the dots before you start designing your own layout.  

Here is the table of contents:

1. Frame based layout VS Auto Layout using constraint 


2. How Auto Layout Engine calculates view position and size


3. Why missing constraints (<span style="color: #e21314;">Red lines!</span>) appear and how to solve them 


4. Why conflicting constraints (<span style="color: #e21314;">Red lines, with numbers!</span>) happen and how to solve them


5. What is intrinsic content size and the importance of it


6. What is constraint priority and when to use it
