# Be skeptical on 'Best Practices'

It's common to come across articles about best practices of iOS development on the internet. Many articles / tutorials claim there's a best guideline to follow on certain topic like Don't use Main Thread for complex calculation, always design for iPhone 8 first, put cell initialization in tableView(willDisplay: cell) method instead of cellForRowAt method etc. 



What does **Best Practices** mean? From Wikipedia, A **best practice** is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to any alternatives because it produces results that are superior to those achieved by other means or because it has become a standard way of doing things.



How does an Article on the internet claim a certain method / way of doing thing is best practice as it requires 'generally accepted as superior', how do you even achieve 'generally accepted' without having to ask half of the iOS developers in the world?



My general rule of thumb is that unless the best practices come from Apple official documentation / channel / presentation, it is the experience or preference of the article author.
