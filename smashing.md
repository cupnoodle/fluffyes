# 5 iOS Performance Tricks to make your app feel more performant



## 1. Dequeue reusable cell

When you search for tutorials on implementing table view on the internet, most of them will instruct you to use the **tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier:, for:)** method in **tableView(_:cellForRowAt:)** to reuse a cell. What is the function of reusable cell? To explain this, we will first look at scenario without using reusable cell.



Say you have a table view with 1000 rows, without using reusable cells, we will have to create a new cell for each row like this : 

```swift
func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    // create a new cell whenever cellForRowAt is called
    let cell = UITableViewCell()
    cell.textLabel?.text = "Cell \(indexPath.row)"
    return cell
}
```



As you might have thought, this will add 1000 cells into your iPhone memory as your scroll to the bottom. Imagine each cell contain an UIImageView and lots of text, loading them all at once might cause the app to run out of memory!



To resolve this, Apple provided us the **dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: , for:)** method. Cell reusing works by placing the cell that is no longer visible in the screen into a queue, and when a new cell is going to be visible in the screen (say, the bottom upcoming cell when user scrolls), the table view will retrieve a cell from this queue and do modification in **cellForRowAt indexPath:** method.



![dequeue](smashing/dequeue.png)



By using a queue to store cells, the tableview doesn't need to create 1000 cells. Instead, it only need just enough cells to cover the area of table view.



By using dequeueReusableCell, we can reduce the memory used by the app and make it less prone to running out of memory!



## 2. Using Launch Screen that look like the initial screen

As mentioned in Apple's [Human Interface Guideline](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/icons-and-images/launch-screen/) , Launch Screen can be used to enhance the perception of the app responsiveness : 

> It‚Äôs solely intended to enhance the perception of your app as quick to launch and immediately ready for use. Every app must supply a launch screen.



When you start a new iOS project, a blank **LaunchScreen.storyboard** will be created. This screen will be shown to user while the app loads the view controllers and layout.



To give an impression of responsive app, we can design the launch screen to be similar to the first screen (view controller) that will be shown to the user.



For example, the Safari app's launch screen is similar to its first view :

![launchscreen](smashing/launchscreen.png)





Launch Screen storyboard is like any other storyboard file, except that you can only use the standard UIKit classes like UIViewController, UITabBarController, UINavigationController etc. If you attempt to use any other custom subclasses (eg: UserViewController), Xcode will notify you that it is illegal to use custom classnames.

![illegal](smashing/illegal.png)



Apple's HIG also advice not to include text on launch screen as launch screen is static and you can't localize text to cater for different languages.



## 3. State restoration for view controllers

State preservation and restoration allow user to return back to the exact same UI state just before they leave the app. Sometimes due to insufficient memory, the operating system might need to remove your app from the memory while your app is in the background, and the app might lose track of its current UI state if it is not preserved, possibly causing users to lose their work progress! üò± 



From Apple's [article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/preserving_your_app_s_ui_across_launches?language=objc) : 

> they expect your app to be in the same state as when they left it. State preservation and restoration ensures that your app returns to its previous state when it launches again.



UIKit has done a lot of work to simplify state preservation and restoration for us, it handles the saving and loading of app state automatically at appropriate times. All we need to do is add some configuration to tell the app to support state preservation / restoration and inform the app what data needs to be preserved.


To enable state saving and restoring, implement this two method in **AppDelegate.swift** :

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldSaveApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {
    return true
}
    
func application(_ application: UIApplication, shouldRestoreApplicationState coder: NSCoder) -> Bool {
    return true
}
```



This will inform the app to save and restore application state automatically.


Next, we inform the app which view controllers will need to be preserved. We do this by specifying the **Restoration ID** in storyboard : 

![restorationID](smashing/restorationID.png)



You can also check '**Use Storyboard ID**' to use storyboard ID as the restoration ID.



To set the restoration ID in code, we can use the **restorationIdentifier** property of the view controller.

```swift
// ViewController.swift
self.restorationIdentifier = "MainVC"
```



During state preservation, any view controller or view that have been assigned a restoration identifier will have it's state saved to disk.



Restoration identifiers can be grouped together to form a restoration path, the identifiers are grouped using the view hierachy, from the root view controller to the current active view controller. Say there's a ScheduleViewController embed inside a Navigation Controller which is embed in another Tab Bar Controller, assuming they are using their own class name as restoration identifier, the restoration path will be like this : 
**TabBarController/NavigationController/ScheduleViewController** . 



When a user leave the app with schedule view controller being the active view controller, this path will be saved by the app, then the app will remember the previous view hierachy shown (Tab Bar Controller -> Navigation Controller -> Schedule View Controller).



After assigning restoration identifier, we will need to implement **encodeRestorableState(with coder:)**  and **decodeRestorableState(with coder:)** methods for each of the preserved view controllers. These two methods let us specify what data needs to be saved/loaded and how to encode/decode them.



In the view controller,

```swift
// ScheduleViewController.swift

// MARK: State restoration
// UIViewController already conform to UIStateRestoring protocol by default
extension ScheduleViewController {
    // will be called during state preservation
    override func encodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {
      
        // encode the data you want to save during state preservation
        coder.encode(self.stationName, forKey: "stationName")
        
        super.encodeRestorableState(with: coder)
    }
    
    // will be called during state restoration
    override func decodeRestorableState(with coder: NSCoder) {
      
      // decode the data saved and load it during state restoration
      if let restoredStationName = coder.decodeObject(forKey: "stationName") as? String {
        self.stationName = restoredStationName
      }
        
        super.decodeRestorableState(with: coder)
    }
}  
```

Remember to call **super** at the bottom of implementation, this is to ensure that the parent class has a chance to save and restore state.



After finishing decoding objects,  **applicationFinishedRestoringState()** method will be called to inform the view controller that the state has been restored. We can update the UI for the view controller in this method.



```swift
// ScheduleViewController.swift

// MARK: State restoration
// UIViewController already conform to UIStateRestoring protocol by default
extension ScheduleViewController {
    ...
  
    override func applicationFinishedRestoringState() {
      // update the UI here
      self.stationNameLabel.text = self.stationName
    }
}
```



There you have it! These are the essential methods to implement state preservation and restoration for an app. Keep in mind that the operating system will remove the saved state when the app is being force closed by the user, this is to prevent that in case something goes wrong in the state preservation / restoration code implementation that caused the app to crash, the app won't stuck in a forever crashing loop. 



Also, don't store any model (eg: data that should have been saved into UserDefaults / Core Data) data into the state although it might seem convenient to do so, as state data will be removed when user force quit your app, you certainly don't want to lose model data like this.



To test that if the state preservation / restoration is working well, you can follow the steps below : 

1. Build and Launch the app in Simulator / Device using Xcode
2. Navigate to the screen you want to test that have state preservation / restoration implemented
3. Return to home screen (by swiping up or double clicking home button, ‚áß‚åòH), to send the app to background
4. Stop the App in Xcode by pressing the ‚èπ button
5. Launch the app again and check if the state has been restored successfully



As this section only covers the basic of state preservation / restoration, I recommend reading these article for advanced knowledge on state restoration : 

1. [Apple's guide on preserving and restoring state](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/PreservingandRestoringState.html)
2. [Apple's article on UI preservation process](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/view_controllers/preserving_your_app_s_ui_across_launches/about_the_ui_preservation_process)

## 4. Reduce usage of non-opaque view as much as possible



Opaque view is view that has no transparency, meaning any UI element placed behind it is not visible at all. We can set a view to be opaque in the interface builder : 

![opaque](smashing/opaque.png)



or programmatically like this `view.isOpaque = true` .Setting a view to opaque will make the drawing system to optimize some drawing performance while rendering the screen.



If a view has transparency (alpha < 1.0), the drawing system of iOS will have to do extra work to calculate  the resulting output display by blending differrent layer of views in the view hierachy. Whereas if a view is set to opaque, the drawing system will just put this view in front and reduce the extra work of blending multiple view layers behind it.



You can check which layers are being blended (non-opaque) in the iOS Simulator by checking **Debug** > **Color Blended Layers**.



![colorBlendedLayers](smashing/colorBlendedLayers.png)



After checking the 'Color Blended Layers' option, you can see that some views are red, some are green. Red color indicates that the view is not opaque and its output display is a result of blending layers behind it. Green color indicates that the view is opaque and no blending is done.



![redGreen](smashing/redGreen.png)



The labels shown above ('View Friends' etc) are filled with red color, this is because when a label is dragged to storyboard, its background color is set to transparent by default. When the drawing system is compositing the display near the label area, it will ask for the layer behind the label and do some calculation.



One of the way to optimize app performance would be to reduce as much red rectangle as possible.



By changing `label.backgroundColor = UIColor.clear` to `label.backgroundColor = UIColor.white`, we can reduce layer blending between label and the view layer behind it.



![greenish](smashing/greenish.png)



You might notice that even if you have set an UIImageView to opaque and assign a background color to it, the simulator still shows red on the image view. This is because by default, the UIImage instance is rendered in graphic context with the opaque option set to false. To remedy this, we can write a function to render the image in graphic context with the opaque option set to true : 

```swift
func opaqueImage(from image: UIImage) -> UIImage {
    let imageSize: CGSize = image.size
    // the 'true' indicates the image context is opaque
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(imageSize, true, UIScreen.main.scale)
    image.draw(in: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: imageSize.width, height: imageSize.height))
    let opaqueImage = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext()
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext()

    // return blank UIImage in case can't get image from image context
    return opaqueImage ?? UIImage()
}
```



We can then use this function to render opaque image and use the resulting UIImage for the UIImageView.





## 5. Pass heavy processing functions to background thread (GCD)

The key of making a responsive app is to move as much heavy processing task to background thread as possible. Avoid doing complex calculation, networking, heavy IO operation (eg: reading / writing to disk) on the main thread, this is because the main thread is used by UIKit to handle and response to user input, and also the drawing of screen.



You might have used some app that suddenly become unresponsive to your touch input before, and it feels like the app has hung, this is most probably caused by the app running heavy computation task on the main thread. 



Main thread usually alternate between UIKit task (eg: handling user input) and some light task in small  intervals. If there is a heavy task going on main thread, UIKit will need to wait until the heavy task has finished before being able to handle touch input.

![mainThread](smashing/mainThread.png)



By default, code inside view controllers lifecycle functions (eg: viewDidLoad) and IBOutlet functions are being executed in the main thread. To move heavy processing task to the background thread, we can utilize [Grand Central Dispatch](https://apple.github.io/swift-corelibs-libdispatch/) queues provided by Apple.



Here's the template for switching queues :

```swift
// Switch to background thread to perform heavy task
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .default).async { 
    // perform heavy task here
  
    // Switch back to main thread to perform UI related task
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // update UI
    }
}
```



The **qos** stands for Quality Of Service, different Quality Of Service indicates different priority for the specificied task. The operating system will allocate more CPU time, CPU power I/O throughput for task allocated in queue with a higher **QoS**, meaning the task will be finished faster in a queue with higher **QoS**, a higher **QoS** will also consume more energy due to it using more resources.



The list of **QoS** from highest priority to lowest priority : 

**.userInteractive** >  **.userInitiated** > **.default** > **.utility** > **.background** .



Apple has provided a handy table with examples of which QoS to use for different tasks here : [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/PrioritizeWorkWithQoS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH39-SW1](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/EnergyGuide-iOS/PrioritizeWorkWithQoS.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015243-CH39-SW1)



One thing to keep in mind is that UI related code **should always** be executed in the main thread. Modifying UI in background thread might have unintended consequence like UI not actually updating, crash etc.



From Apple's [article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/main_thread_checker) : 

> Updating UI on a thread other than the main thread is a common mistake that can result in missed UI updates, visual defects, data corruptions, and crashes.



I recommend watching Apple 2012 WWDC video on UI concurrency to get more understanding on building a responsive app :

[Building Concurrent User Interfaces on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2012/211/)
